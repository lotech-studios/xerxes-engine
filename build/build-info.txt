Xerxes Engine r2
WebGL-based JavaScript Engine
Developed by Nikolas Karinja

NOTE: This Engine utilizes some of the source code of the library "Three.js".
The reason for doing so was the fact that "Three.js" is open-source and probides
an excellent base for any WebGL-based engine. The revision of "Three.js" in which 
the current revision of the Xerxes Engine is based upon is "138dev".
